# powerbi-profit-dashboard

This project demonstrates how to present visualized profit data using Power BI. 

The 'profit-dashboard' file presents several indicators, such as annual and quarterly achievement rates, gross rate, a line graph showing the change in profit, and a comparison of two months.

The 'profit-by-account' file presents cost and investment recommendations by the dimension of each account.
